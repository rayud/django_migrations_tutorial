## Introduction

Indexes are essential for improving the performance of database queries. In Django, you can define indexes directly in your models or add them later using migrations. For large tables, adding indexes can be time-consuming and may lock the table, making it unavailable for read and write operations. To avoid this, PostgreSQL provides the `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` option, which can be used in Django migrations to add indexes without locking the table.

## Creating Indexes in Django Models

You can define indexes directly in your Django models using the `Meta` class. Here's an example:

```python
from django.db import models

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    class Meta:
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['name'], name='student_name_idx')
        ]
```

In this example, an index is created on the `name` field of the `Student` model with the name `student_name_idx`.

## Adding Indexes Concurrently in Django Migrations

For large tables, it is advisable to add indexes concurrently to avoid locking the table. Django provides a way to do this using the `AddIndexConcurrently` operation.

Here's an example of how to add an index concurrently in a migration:

```python
from django.db import migrations, models
from django.contrib.postgres.operations import AddIndexConcurrently

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    atomic = False

    dependencies = []

    operations = [
        AddIndexConcurrently(
            model_name='product',
            index=models.Index(fields=['slug'], name='product_slug_idx')
        )
    ]
```

In this example, an index is added to the `slug` field of the `Product` model concurrently, with the index name `product_slug_idx`.

## Manually Creating Concurrent Indexes

If you need more control or need to perform custom SQL operations, you can manually create indexes concurrently using the `RunSQL` operation in Django migrations.

Here's an example:

```python
from django.db import migrations

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    operations = [
        migrations.RunSQL(
            sql='CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY "product_slug_idx" ON "inventory_product" ("slug");',
            reverse_sql='DROP INDEX "product_slug_idx";'
        )
    ]
```

In this example, an index is created on the `slug` field of the `inventory_product` table concurrently, and a corresponding `DROP INDEX` statement is provided to reverse the operation if needed.

## Conclusion

Using indexes in Django models and migrations can significantly improve the performance of your database queries. For large tables, creating indexes concurrently helps avoid table locks, ensuring your application remains responsive during the indexing process. By following the examples provided, you can effectively manage indexes in your Django projects.
