**What is Migrations in Django**:

Django migrations are like a set of instructions that help update and manage your database whenever you make changes to your Django models. They ensure that your database structure matches the models in your Django app, so when you add, change, or delete fields and tables, everything stays organized and consistent

**The workflow of Django migrations typically involves several steps**:

1. **Make Changes to Models**: Modify your Django models (`models.py`) to reflect the desired changes in your database schema, such as adding new fields, altering existing ones, or creating/deleting tables.
2. **Create Migration Files**: After making changes to your models, generate migration files using the `makemigrations` command:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   ```

   This command analyzes your models and creates migration files (`0001_initial.py`, `0002_auto_20230518_1532.py`, etc.) in the `migrations` directory of each app.

   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations app_name
   ```

   This command generates migrations for a specific Django app.
3. **Review Generated Migrations**: Inspect the generated migration files (`migrations/0001_initial.py`, etc.) to ensure they accurately reflect the changes you made. These files contain Python code that describes how to apply or revert the changes to your database schema.
4. **Apply Migrations**: Once satisfied with the migrations, apply them to your database using the `migrate` command:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

   This command executes the migration files in sequence, updating the database schema to match your models.
5. **Check Migration Status**: Use the `showmigrations` command to view the status of migrations across your apps:

   ```bash
   python manage.py showmigrations
   ```

   It lists which migrations have been applied (`[X]`) and which are pending (`[ ]`).
6. **Rollback Migrations (Optional)**: If needed, you can roll back migrations to a specific point using:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate app_name migration_name
   ```

   Replace `app_name` with your app's name and `migration_name` with the specific migration name or number.

This workflow ensures that your database schema stays synchronized with your Django models as they evolve over time.
