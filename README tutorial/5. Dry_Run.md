### Overview

The `--dry-run` option is useful for simulating the creation of migration files, allowing you to see what changes would be made before they are actually applied.

## Usage

To preview the migrations without creating the actual migration files, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations --dry-run
```
