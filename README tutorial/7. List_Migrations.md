# Listing Migrations in Django

This guide explains how to list migrations in Django using the `showmigrations` command. This command is useful for understanding which migrations have been applied to your database and for getting detailed information about your project's migrations.

Django's `showmigrations` command provides a way to list migrations and see which ones have been applied to your database. This command can be customized with various options to show detailed information, filter by app, and more.

## Basic Usage

To list all migrations for your project, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py showmigrations
```

In the output, an `X` before a migration indicates that it has already been applied to the database.

## Listing Migrations for All Apps

The `showmigrations` command without any additional arguments will list migrations for all apps in your project:

```bash
python manage.py showmigrations
```

Output example:

```
app_name
 [X] 0001_initial
 [X] 0002_auto_20230518_1234
 [ ] 0003_add_new_field
```

## Listing Migrations for a Specific App

To list migrations for a specific app, provide the app name as an argument:

```bash
python manage.py showmigrations app_name
```

Output example:

```
app_name
 [X] 0001_initial
 [X] 0002_auto_20230518_1234
 [ ] 0003_add_new_field
```

## Detailed Output with Verbosity Levels

The `showmigrations` command supports different verbosity levels to control the amount of detail shown:

- **v0**: Shows a simple list of migrations.
- **v1**: Default verbosity level.
- **v2**: Shows more detailed output, including migration dependencies.
- **v3**: Shows the most detailed output, including SQL statements.

To list migrations for a specific app with the highest verbosity level (v3), use:

```bash
python manage.py showmigrations app_name -v3
```

Output example:

```
app_name
 [X] 0001_initial
  - Create model MyModel
  - Add field new_field to MyModel
 [X] 0002_auto_20230518_1234
  - Alter field existing_field on MyModel
 [ ] 0003_add_new_field
  - Add field another_field to MyModel
```

## Saving Migrations to a File

You can save the output of the `showmigrations` command to a file for later review or documentation purposes:

```bash
python manage.py showmigrations app_name -p -v3 > migrations.txt
```

This command will write the detailed migration information to `migrations.txt`.

## Getting Help

To get help for the `showmigrations` command and see all available options, use:

```bash
python manage.py showmigrations --help
```
