**What is Empty migrations:**

Empty migrations in Django are migrations with no predefined schema-altering operations, allowing for custom manual operations such as adding indexes, constraints, or executing raw SQL. They provide flexibility for advanced database modifications not handled by Django's automatic migrations. Create them using

`python manage.py makemigrations app_name --empty`.

### Use Cases for Empty Migrations

1. **Adding Custom Indexes or Constraints**

   Example:

   ```python
   from django.db import migrations

   class Migration(migrations.Migration):

       dependencies = [
           ('app_name', 'previous_migration'),
       ]

       operations = [
           migrations.RunSQL(
               sql="CREATE INDEX my_custom_index ON my_table (my_column);",
               reverse_sql="DROP INDEX my_custom_index;"
           ),
       ]
   ```
2. **Modifying Table Structures**

   Example:

   ```python
   from django.db import migrations

   class Migration(migrations.Migration):

       dependencies = [
           ('app_name', 'previous_migration'),
       ]

       operations = [
           migrations.RunSQL(
               sql="ALTER TABLE my_table ADD COLUMN new_column VARCHAR(100);",
               reverse_sql="ALTER TABLE my_table DROP COLUMN new_column;"
           ),
       ]
   ```
3. **Executing Raw SQL Queries**

   Example:

   ```python
   from django.db import migrations

   class Migration(migrations.Migration):

       dependencies = [
           ('app_name', 'previous_migration'),
       ]

       operations = [
           migrations.RunSQL(
               sql="UPDATE my_table SET column = 'value' WHERE condition;",
               reverse_sql="UPDATE my_table SET column = 'old_value' WHERE condition;"
           ),
       ]
   ```
4. **Calling Stored Procedures or Triggers**

   Example:

   ```python
   from django.db import migrations

   class Migration(migrations.Migration):

       dependencies = [
           ('app_name', 'previous_migration'),
       ]

       operations = [
           migrations.RunSQL(
               sql="CALL my_stored_procedure();",
               reverse_sql="-- Add reverse SQL if applicable"
           ),
       ]
   ```

## Named Migrations

Named migrations allow you to specify a custom name for the migration file. This can be combined with the `--empty` option for clarity and organization.

### Creating a Named Empty Migration

To create a named empty migration, use:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations app_name --empty --name custom_migration_name
```

This creates an empty migration file with the specified name.

### Creating a Named Migration with Changes

If you want to create a named migration that includes detected changes, use:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations app_name --name custom_migration_name
```

This will create a migration file with the specified name, including any changes detected in your models.

## Conclusion

Empty and named migrations provide powerful tools for managing advanced database operations in Django. They allow for greater flexibility and control, enabling you to perform custom modifications and ensure your database schema meets all your requirements.
